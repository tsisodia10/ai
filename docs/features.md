# Features

Praxis AI extends the [Praxis proxy framework][praxis] with AI-specific
filters and provider integrations. This page describes the capability
areas; the generated [filter reference](filters/reference.md) is the
authoritative inventory of filter names and configuration documentation.

For base proxy capabilities such as TLS, HTTP/2, TCP, WebSocket, load
balancing, rate limiting, compression, CORS, health checks, and credential
injection, see the [Praxis core documentation][praxis].

## Inference routing and transformation

- Classify requests by provider format, model, streaming mode, and tool
  composition, then promote those facts for policy-driven routing.
- Rewrite models and enrich prompts without changing application code.
- Translate Anthropic Messages requests and responses for
  Chat Completions-compatible inference backends.
- Normalize provider protocol headers and validate the JSON envelope fields
  required by the proxy.

## OpenAI Responses and Conversations

- Proxy native Responses API traffic and rebuild enriched request state.
- Store and rehydrate response history through SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- Serve the Conversations API locally and maintain conversation items.
- Resolve file references, extract supported document content, and accumulate
  streaming response state.
- Parse tool configuration and dispatch MCP or web-search tool calls in an
  agentic loop.

See the generated [OpenAI filter inventory](filters/reference.md#openai)
for the complete list.

## Anthropic Messages

- Classify and validate Anthropic Messages requests.
- Normalize native Anthropic protocol headers.
- Translate request, response, and streaming event formats for compatible
  OpenAI-style backends.

See the generated [Anthropic filter inventory](filters/reference.md#anthropic).

## Agentic protocols

- Classify and route Model Context Protocol (MCP) traffic.
- Broker configured MCP catalog operations and upstream tool discovery.
- Classify Agent-to-Agent (A2A) requests and route task or context follow-ups.
- Build on the JSON-RPC primitives provided by Praxis core.

## Safety and observability

- Evaluate request content through an external guardrail provider.
- Extract token usage across supported provider response formats.
- Expose normalized token counts through downstream response headers.

## Cargo features

A default build (`cargo build -p praxis-ai-proxy`) compiles the `standard`
feature set: every filter on this page except the groups below, which carry
heavier dependencies or a large amount of stateful code and compile only when
their feature is enabled. The published container image and `make release`
build `full`, which matches the complete filter set. The FIPS build
(`make release-fips`, the `-fips` image) compiles `openai-responses` and
`aws-sigv4-filter` with the certificate-only PostgreSQL store on top of the
always-on filters; [FIPS 140-3](fips.md) lists what is left out and why.

| Feature | Filters it adds | Notable dependencies |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `aws-sigv4-filter` (part of `standard`) | `aws_sigv4_sign` | `aws-credential-types`; the signature is computed by the system OpenSSL |
| `openai-responses` | `openai_responses_validate`, `openai_responses_proxy`, `openai_stream_events`, `responses_to_chat_completions`, `openai_doc_extract`, `openai_client_tool_compat`, `openai_agentic_loop`, `openai_file_search_callout`, `openai_web_search` | none beyond the default build |
| `openai-file-resolve-filter` | `openai_file_resolve` | `reqwest` |
| `store-postgres`, `store-postgres-cert-auth`, `store-sqlite`, `store-all` | `openai_response_store`, `openai_responses_rehydrate`, and the SQL backends | `sqlx` (PostgreSQL adds native TLS through the system OpenSSL; the certificate-only profile omits password authentication) |
| `openai-conversations` | `openai_conversations` | `jsonschema`, `utoipa`, a store backend |
| `openai-compact` | `openai_responses_compact` | `tiktoken-rs`, a store backend |
| `openai-mcp-tools` | `openai_mcp_tool_resolve`, `openai_mcp_dispatch`, `openai_mcp_streaming_selector` | `rmcp`, a store backend |
| `openai-all` | every OpenAI group above, without choosing a store backend | |
| `full` | `standard`, `openai-all`, and `store-postgres` | |

The store-backed groups need a backend at runtime, so pair them with
`store-postgres` or `store-sqlite` (for example
`--features openai-all,store-sqlite`). The experimental `http-callout-filter`,
`azure-ad-filter`, `gcp-adc-filter`, `token-rate-limit-filter`, and
`basic-auth-filter` features, and the `llmd-ext-proc` and `opentelemetry`
features, are opt-in as before. A configuration that names a filter the binary
was built without fails at startup with an unknown filter type error.

## Extensibility

Custom Rust filters implement the `HttpFilter` trait from `praxis-filter` and
register through the `register_filters!` macro. External filter crates can
self-register at build time with `[package.metadata.praxis-filters]`.

Start with the [example configurations](../examples/README.md), then use the
[filter reference](filters/reference.md) for exact configuration fields.
