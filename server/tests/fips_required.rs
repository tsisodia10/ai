//! not in FIPS mode the binary must refuse to start and say why; on a FIPS
//! host it must start normally, unless it carries the policy engine or a
//! response-store profile whose dependencies do their own cryptography, in
//! which case it must refuse and name the filters. The isolated
//! certificate-authentication store profile is allowed. Every branch is
//! asserted, so the test is meaningful wherever it runs, and a control run
//! without the variable proves the variable is what changes the outcome.
